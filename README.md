# ft_containers

The goal of this project is to achieve a some of STL containers in C++.

The rules:

* Recode entirely Vector, Stack and Map
* Implement AVL-tree for the perf
* Recode all the iterator
* Use allocator instead of new
* Template everything like the STL


You want to play with it? You can import all the includes/* files and call my containers with the ft namespace ;)
